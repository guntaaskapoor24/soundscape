**About:**
  SoundScape was developed in 2025 as a personal project. It is song recommender system that recommends the user top 5 most similar songs to the one 
  entered by the user.

**Algorithm:**
  SoundScape uses K - Means Clustering to group songs together based on their common characteristics like instrumentalness, acousticness, valence etc. In other words, SoundScape uses Content - Based Filtering to group together songs based on similar characteristics.
  It then provides top 5 recommendations.

**Data:**
  The dataset used was downloaded from Kaggle and then modified and cleaned to remove accent marks and make it more useful. 
  
**Deployment:**
  The application has been deployed successfully on Streamlit Cloud.
